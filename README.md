# Etch-a-Sketch 👨🏾‍💻

Etch-a-Sketch project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project/) Foundations course. 

### Objective: 
Create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.<br>
[Live Demo 👈](https://ikeronx.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

#### Steps:
1. Create a web page with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Add a button to the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid.  Once entered, the new grid should be generated *in the same total space as before* (e.g. 960px wide) and now you've got a new sketch pad.
4. (Optional): Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example), have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value.~~Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it, so only after 10 passes is the square completely black.~~

- Improved clean code writing.
- A lot of minor things.
